### Rules and list building

Rules and list-building guidelines for Matched Play apply, in short:
1000 points, and you can bring up to 3 heroes, 2 allies, 3 thralls and 1
monster.

Dagger, Shield and Hammer will be the same for all battles and must be
chosen prior to the tournament, so read the battleplans and choose
wisely.

Only fighters with stats/points from the new edition will be allowed.

### Scoring system

**Major Victory (20 pts):** Won the battle and less than half of the
fighters in your warband were taken down.

**Minor Victory (15 pts):** Won the battle but half or more of the
fighters in your warband were taken down.

**Draw (10 pts):** Drew the battle

**Minor loss (5 pts):** Lost the battle but half or more of the fighters
in your opponent’s warband were taken down.

**Major loss (0 pts):** Lost the battle and less than half of the
fighters in your opponent’s warband were taken down.

*Tournament winner* (highest total number of points) and *best painted
warband* (based on voting).
